# README

This repository contains a Python code that uses the Pygame and OpenGL libraries to create an interactive 3D environment. The code implements a scenario with walls and a checkered floor, as well as a camera that can be moved by the user.

## Features

- Camera Movement: The camera can be moved by the user using the W, A, S, and D keys to move forward, left, backward, and right, respectively. The camera rotation is controlled by mouse movement.
- 3D Visualization: The environment is rendered using the OpenGL library, providing a 3D visual experience.

## Requirements

Make sure you have the following requirements installed in your development environment:

- Python (version 3.6 or higher)
- Pygame (version 2.0.1 or higher)
- PyOpenGL (version 3.1.5 or higher)

## Installing PyOpenGL

To install PyOpenGL, you can use pip, the package installer for Python. Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

```
pip install PyOpenGL
```

This will download and install the latest version of PyOpenGL from the Python Package Index (PyPI).

## How to Run the Code

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the files.
2. Make sure you have the aforementioned requirements installed in your development environment.
3. Navigate to the directory where the repository files are located.
4. Run the `room.py` Python file using the following command: `python room.py`.
5. The program will start, and you can interact with the 3D environment using the keys and mouse as described in the features.
